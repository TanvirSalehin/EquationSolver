# EquationSolver
This is an equation solver. But before you go on and try this only to complain about it, consider reading these.

1. This is not a complete project, it is being worked on and will be improved In Shaa Allah. 
3. Currently it supports only integer solutions. Non-integer solutions like 1.2, âˆš2 etc are not supported.
4. They way that this code runs is very inefficient and the idea behind solving equations is also very stupid. So feel free to change/develop the code.
5. If you have any questions or any better idea, please consider sharing your idea or questions to tanvirsalehin2988@gmail.com

By the way, how this code runs and further information is given in the code.
